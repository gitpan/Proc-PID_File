WHAT IS IT
==========

This is a module to manage Unix PID files, which are files that store
process identifier. A script (usually a daemon) can create a PID file to
check whether it is already running, so it can avoid creating multiple
instances of itself.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Just type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

and you should be all set.

HOW TO USE
==========

For the usage, please consult POD document embedded in the library. Also,

    perldoc Proc::PID_File

should show you the document if installed correctly.
